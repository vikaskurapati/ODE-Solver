 ### General Idea
 This is a solver for an Ordinary Differential Equation problem. Explicit and Implicit Euler schemes are used to solve the Ordinary Differential Equations. 

 ### Instructions for use
 1. Enter the gradient function, initial value of function, total time duration and time step.
 2. The gradient is to be input as a lamba function which is a function of x, t. x is the variable being solved for and t is the independent variable.
 3. For example, $frac{dx}{dt} = e^t$ is shown here. $`frac{dx}{dt} = e^x`$ would return $e^x$.
